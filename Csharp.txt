Class:
-----
It is a collection of Objects,Methods & Variables.

Object:
-------
Instance of a class is said to be a Object.

Basic Oops Concepts:
-------------------
Abstraction:
-----------
Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and displaying the essential features to the outside world.

Encapsulation:
--------------
Encapsulation is a process of binding the data members and member functions into a single unit.

Inheritance:
------------
Inheritance is a process of deriving the new class from already existing class.

Polymorphism:
-------------

--> It allows you to invoke methods of derived class through base class reference during runtime.
--> It has the ability for classes to provide different implementations of methods that are called through the same name.

Polymorphism is of two types:
-----------------------------
 
1) Compile time polymorphism/Overloading
2) Runtime polymorphism/Overriding

Compile Time Polymorphism:
-------------------------
Compile time polymorphism is method and operators overloading. 
It is also called early binding.

In method overloading method performs the different task at the different input parameters.
 
Runtime Time Polymorphism:
-------------------------
 
Runtime time polymorphism is done using inheritance and virtual functions.
Method overriding is called runtime polymorphism.
It is also called late binding.

Collections In C#:
-----------------
1) Arraylist:
   --------
It represents ordered collection of an object that can be "INDEXED" individually.

2) Hashtable:
   ---------
It uses a "KEY" to access the elements in the collection.

3) Sortedlist:
   ----------
It uses a "KEY" as well as an "INDEX" to access the items in a list.

4) Stack:
   -----
It represents a LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT (LIFO) collection of object.

5) Queue:
   -----
It represents a FIRST-IN,FIRST-OUT (FIFO) collection of object.

6) Bit Array:
   ---------
It represents an array of the binary representation using the values 1 and 0.

Types of Inheritance:
--------------------
1) Single(A,B:A)
2) Hierarchical(A,B:A,C:A,.....)
3) Multi-Level(A,B:A,C:B,...)
4) Multiple (Using Interface)(IA,IB,C:IA,IB)

How do you prevent a class from being inherited?
A) Use SEALED keyword
